### TASK 1 
1. User Input: The program prompts the user to enter two numbers using `input()`. Since `input()` returns a string, `int(x)` and `int(y)` convert these inputs into integers for calculations.
2. discribe the value of x and y as integer value as int(x) and int(y)

3. Arithmetic Operations: It calculates:
   - **Addition (`x + y`)** -> Stores the sum in `ad`
   - **Subtraction (`x - y`)** -> Stores the difference in `sub`
   - **Multiplication (`x * y`)** -> Stores the product in `mul`
   - **Division (`x / y`)** -> Stores the quotient in `div`

4. **Displaying Results:** The program prints the results of each arithmetic operation using `print()`.


   ### TASK 2
1. User Input: 
   - `x = input("Enter your first name:")`-> Takes the first name from the user.  
   - `y = input("Enter your last name:")` -> Takes the last name from the user.

2. Concatenation of Names: 
   - `z = x + " " + y` -> Combines the first and last name with a space in between, storing it in `z`.

3. Displaying the Greeting:
   - `print("Hello,", z, "! Welcome to the python program.")` â†’ Prints the greeting message with the user's full name.
